Monty Hall Problem – JavaScript

This project simulates the Monty Hall Problem 1000 times using JavaScript. The goal is to show whether a contestant should stay with their original door or switch after the host opens a door with a goat.

How It Works

A car is placed randomly behind one of three doors.

The contestant randomly picks a door.

The host opens another door that never reveals the car.

If the contestant’s first choice has the car → staying wins.

If not → switching wins.

Result

The script counts how many times switching is correct and shows the percentage.
Switching usually wins about 66% of the time.
